Background

- This is a self-motivating progress report page for my development practices
- The first project is chrome bookmark extension using the scroll_value in javascript.

Scenario

- User saved the link as bookmark because the user found a useful information in form of text or image in the webpage
- Bookmarks only saves the header title and the url links
- and they do not directly guide users to the point of useful information when revisited

Features

- Re-open the location of information by retrieving the scroll location value when bookmark is saved
